# LockPerms
If anyone would like a real janky password protected luckperms plugin feel free to use this. Imma use it when i go to bed to prevent any LP actions being carried out before I can double check them in the morning. I'm sure i'll update it to actually integrate in to LP api in future when i learn more Java
perm node: ``lockperms.admin``  
-/lockperms log - displays log of LP commands  
-/lockperms log remove <index> - remove an unwanted command from log  
-/lockperms confirm [password] - confirm commands for execution  
-/lockperms active [true/false] [password]

and of course if you would like to use/tweak it for yourself here is the source - although do let me know any cool features you add so i can try them too :D!
